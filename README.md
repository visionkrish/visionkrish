 # ML engineer building real-time 3D perception systems

  **3D vision** • **Real-time systems** • **Research-to-production**

  Building towards AI-native design tools. Currently interested in robotics, spatial AI, and problems at the intersection of geometry and learning.

  ## Skills

  **Languages:** Python, C++, CUDA, TypeScript, JavaScript

  **ML/DL:** PyTorch, self-supervised learning, GANs, domain adaptation, quantization, distillation

  **3D Vision:** Registration, pose estimation, segmentation, mesh processing, SMPL, PyTorch3D, VTK

  **Infrastructure:** TensorRT, ONNX, FastAPI, Docker, DVC, Ray, AWS, CUDA optimization, edge deployment

  **Frontend:** React, Three.js, real-time visualization

  ## Current Work

  - **VisionForge** - AI-native design tool for geometry and real-time simulation
  - **ava-track** - 3D temporal face tracking with real-time mesh reconstruction
  - **ava-codec** - Neural compression for 3D temporal data
  - **agent-cache** - Local semantic memory system (C, C++, Zig, Rust)
